# AI Development Support: Improving AI Interpretation & Philosophy

## Project Overview

This project documents findings and proposes improvements to AI interpretation mechanisms, based on a verified case study of AI fabrication patterns in GitHub Copilot and a comprehensive testing framework for detecting similar issues across AI systems.

## Structure

- `findings/` - Documented AI interpretation issues and analysis
- `framework/` - Research methodology and analysis framework
- `proposals/` - GitHub proposal and research summaries
- `examples/` - Case studies and specific examples
- `tools/` - Potential tools for testing and improvement

## Research Status

**Current Status**: One verified case study (Spotify URL fabrication in GitHub Copilot) with comprehensive testing framework ready for broader validation.

## Goals

1. **Document AI Interpretation Issues**: Analysis of verified AI fabrication patterns and failure modes
2. **Develop Testing Framework**: Automated detection system for AI fabrication across platforms  
3. **Engage with GitHub**: Present findings and collaborate on AI reliability improvements
4. **Advance AI Research**: Contribute systematic methodology for AI reliability assessment

## Status

ðŸ”„ **Active Development** - Documenting findings and preparing research proposals
