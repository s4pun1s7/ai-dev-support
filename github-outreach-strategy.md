## üìß **Recommended Email Template for GitHub Research**

**To**: research@github.com  
**Subject**: Research Collaboration: AI Reliability and Fabrication Detection Framework

**Body**:
```
Dear GitHub Research Team,

I've developed a comprehensive research framework for detecting and analyzing AI fabrication patterns in development tools, with particular focus on GitHub Copilot and similar AI assistants.

**Research Repository**: https://github.com/s4pun1s7/ai-dev-support

**Key Findings**:
- Systematic documentation of AI fabrication patterns when processing URLs
- 100% fabrication rate across tested categories (music platforms, code repositories, etc.)
- Production-ready testing framework with automated pattern detection
- Specific recommendations for improving AI reliability and user trust

**Research Value for GitHub**:
- Quantifiable metrics for AI system reliability
- Reproducible test cases for validation
- Framework for measuring improvements over time
- Academic-quality research ready for collaboration

**Request**: I'd like to discuss potential collaboration opportunities, including:
- Validating findings with GitHub Copilot
- Contributing to AI reliability improvements
- Sharing methodology with the broader AI development community

The research addresses fundamental trust and reliability issues that affect all AI development tools. I believe this work could significantly benefit GitHub's AI initiatives and the developer community.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your GitHub: @s4pun1s7]

## üê¶ **Twitter/Social Media Strategy**

**Tweet Template**:
```
üî¨ New research: AI fabrication detection framework for development tools

Found 100% fabrication rate when AI systems can't access URLs - they confidently provide wrong information instead of admitting limitations

Framework includes automated testing & pattern detection

@GitHubDev @GitHub thoughts?

## üí° **GitHub Community Discussion Post**

**Title**: "Research: AI Fabrication Patterns in Development Tools - Need Community Feedback"

**Content**:
```
Hi GitHub Community!

I've been researching AI reliability issues and developed a framework for detecting when AI systems fabricate information instead of admitting they can't access external data.

**Repository**: https://github.com/s4pun1s7/ai-dev-support

**Key Finding**: 100% fabrication rate across tested scenarios - AI confidently provides wrong information about Spotify songs, GitHub code, YouTube videos, etc., instead of saying "I can't access that."

**Why This Matters for Developers**:
- Trust in AI development tools
- Accuracy of AI-generated code explanations  
- User experience with AI assistants

**Looking For**:
- Community validation of findings
- Additional test cases from your experiences
- Collaboration opportunities with GitHub Research

Has anyone else noticed similar AI reliability issues? Would love to hear your experiences and thoughts!

## üéØ **Best Strategy: Multi-Channel Approach**

### **Week 1: Direct Outreach**
1. **Email GitHub Research** (research@github.com) with your full proposal
2. **Create GitHub Community Discussion** for visibility
3. **Tweet to @GitHubDev** with key findings

### **Week 2: Follow-up**
1. **Monitor responses** and engage with community feedback
2. **Reach out to GitHub employees** on LinkedIn who work on AI/ML
3. **Consider academic conferences** (if no direct GitHub response)

### **Week 3: Expand**
1. **Blog post** on Medium/Dev.to about your findings
2. **Submit to research conferences** (ICSE, FSE, etc.)
3. **Engage with AI research community** on Twitter
